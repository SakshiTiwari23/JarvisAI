Below is a revised version to help you avoid indentation errors and incorrect payload formatting. The latest OpenAI Python library (`openai`, not `OpenAI`) expects more standard arguments for completions or chat completions. If you are using `openai>=1.0.0`, the syntax is a bit different.\n\n**Here’s a corrected version using the most common usage (`openai` as of early 2024):**\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom config import apikey\n\nopenai.api_key = apikey\n\n# Compose the prompt\nprompt = (\n    \"Write a professional resignation email to your boss.  \\n\"\n    \"- Include a brief expression of gratitude for the opportunities or experiences you had at the company.\\n\"\n    \"- Clearly state your intention to resign and provide your final working day, following standard notice period etiquette (typically two weeks unless otherwise specified).\\n\"\n    \"- Offer to assist with the transition or training of your replacement, if appropriate.\\n\"\n    \"- Maintain a polite, positive, and professional tone throughout.\\n\"\n    \"- Do not include unnecessary personal details or complaints.\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"Output format:  \\n\"\n    \"- The email as full text in business email format. \\n\"\n    \"- Include a subject line.\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"Example:\\n\"\n    \"Subject: Resignation Letter\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"Dear [Boss's Name],\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"I am writing to formally resign from my position at [Company Name], effective [Last Working Day, e.g., two weeks from today]. \"\n    \"I appreciate the opportunities and support I have received during my time here and am grateful for the experience gained. \"\n    \"I am committed to making the transition as smooth as possible and am happy to assist with training or other needs over the next two weeks.\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"Thank you again for the opportunity.\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"Best regards,  \\n\"\n    \"[Your Name]\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"(Real emails should tailor the content to your specific situation, provide your actual last working day, and include your boss’s and company’s name.)\\n\"\n    \"\\n\"\n    \"IMPORTANT REMINDER:  \\n\"\n    \"Your objective is to write a concise, polite, and professional resignation email that clearly communicates your intention, your last day, and your gratitude. \"\n    \"Avoid negative comments and keep the focus on professionalism and transition.\"\n)\n\n# Call the API (for chat models, e.g., gpt-4)\nresponse = openai.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-4.0-turbo\",\n    messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}\n    ],\n    temperature=1,\n    max_tokens=700,\n    top_p=1\n)\n\nprint(response.choices[0].message.content)\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- Use `openai.chat.completions.create` for chat models such as GPT-4.\n- The `messages` parameter should be a list of message dicts (`role: system|user|assistant, content`).\n- Directly pass your prompt as a string for the `\"user\"` role.\n- Double-check your indentation and syntax in Python.\n\n**If you’re using a different/older version of the OpenAI API:**\n- Double-check the library reference in your imports (`openai`, not `OpenAI`).\n- The input structure may differ for completions vs chat completions.\n\nLet me know if you need help updating your `requirements.txt` or have other API-specific questions!"

Always use only spaces (most editors convert tabs to spaces automatically).\n- **Accidentally indented** lines that should have no indentation (flush left).\n- **Copy-pasting from formatted documents** sometimes introduces invisible characters or extra spaces—try pasting as plain text.\n\n**If problem persists:**\n- Look at the exact line number provided with the error. Ensure there are no spaces or tabs at the start of any lines unless required.\n- Try typing the code out manually, instead of pasting, for the first few lines.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, **copy your code here** (with line numbers if possible) and I can show you exactly where to fix the indentation!"
